Creatine Clearance Calculator
-----------------------------

The Creatine Clearance Calculator is based on [MDCalc Creatine Clearance Calculator with Cockcroft Gault equation](https://www.mdcalc.com/creatinine-clearance-cockcroft-gault-equation). 

Obtains the available information from FHIR server in order to make the calculation and show the result. 
In this way, physicians won't need to access [MDCalc](https://www.mdcalc.com/) website to get this information, since it would be integrated in the EMR system.
